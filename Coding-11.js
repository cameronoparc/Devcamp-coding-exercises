//Coding Exercise
//Add the correct arithmetic operators to make variable equal the number in the comment.
numOne = 5 10 // add the right Arithmetic Operators to have it equal 15

numTwo = 90 3 // add the right Arithmetic Operators to have it equal 30

numThree = 50 25 // add the right Arithmetic Operators to have it equal 25

numFour =  20 5 // add the right Arithmetic Operators to have it equal 100
/////
numOne = 5 + 10;
numTwo = 90 / 3;

numThree = 50 - 25;

numFour =  20 * 5;
