//Coding Exercise
//Inside the below function, write a variable and give it a string that says "It's a trap!" Then on the return (just like a console.log) use string interpolation to finish the movie line
function movieLine() {
    const str = "It's a trap!";
    
    return (`Admiral! We have enemies in Sector 7! ${str}`);
}
